# Spring Boot CI/CD Workflow

This repository contains a sample Spring Boot application along with a GitHub Actions workflow that showcases a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to illustrate how to set up an automated CI/CD workflow for a Spring Boot application using GitHub Actions. The workflow includes building and testing the application, and on successful builds, deploying the application to a server or a cloud platform.

## Features

- Automated building and testing of the Spring Boot application.
- Automated deployment to a server or cloud platform on successful builds.
- Demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Integrates with popular CI/CD tools and services.

## CI/CD Workflow

The CI/CD workflow is defined in the [.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) file. It includes the following steps:

1. **Checkout Code:**
   - The workflow starts by checking out the source code from the repository.

2. **Set Up Java Environment:**
   - Sets up the Java environment using GitHub Actions' `setup-java` action.

3. **Build and Test:**
   - Builds the Spring Boot application using Maven.
   - Runs tests to ensure the application's correctness.

4. **Deploy (Example):**
   - Deploys the application to a predefined environment (e.g., server, cloud platform).
   - This step serves as a placeholder; you can customize it based on your deployment requirements.

## Usage

To use this CI/CD workflow for your Spring Boot projects, follow these steps:

1. **Customize Workflow:**
   - Customize the [.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) file to fit your project structure and requirements.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - If your deployment requires sensitive information (e.g., API keys), use GitHub Secrets or environment variables in the workflow.

3. **Push to Repository:**
   - Push your changes to the GitHub repository, and the workflow will automatically trigger.
